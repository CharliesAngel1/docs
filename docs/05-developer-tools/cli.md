## Bootstrap your dApp in seconds

If you're looking to start a new dApp, in seconds, you can use our `create-moralis-dapp` tool.

Simply run the following command in the directory where you want your dApp to be created:

```bash
npx create-moralis-dapp
```

Then follow the questions in the CLI, to bootstrap your dApp.

This will guide you throughout setting up your dApp with:

- Your specified frontend and/or backend
- Your api-key
- Any additional configuration depending on the previous selections (such as your preferred web3 provider, styling system etc.)
- *...and more to come!*

## Supported stacks

Currently we have support for:

- React
- NextJs
- ExpressJs
- .*..more coming soon!*
